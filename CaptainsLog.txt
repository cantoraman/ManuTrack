python manage.py startapp jobs
add basic view to views
create urls.py to map url reqs

at urls OF JOBS:
import path from djangourls
import views in the current level
set the '' path to point views.index

at Urls of ROOT
add include to include own packages
aaaaand include the jobs.url on the url patterns
>
The include() function allows referencing other URLconfs. Whenever Django encounters include(), it chops off whatever part of the URL matched up to that point and sends the remaining string to the included URLconf for further processing.

set the timezone to UTC at settings.py

python manage.py migrate to set the DB

>sqlite3 enters sqlite console / ctrl D exits

start creating classes/models

app is done, add it to settings.py @ root
in apps=> 'jobs.apps.JobConfig',

make migrations = python manage.py makemigrations jobs

then migrate = python manage.py migrate

In the playground I was a little bit clumsy. So, let's make a recap:

Enter the shell with
    python manage.py shell

import all of your models
    from jobs.models import Designer, Manufacturer, Job

crete an instance of your model

m = Manufacturer(manufacturer_name="Hasan")

this instantiates it but does not save it to the database
to save it:

m.save()

now, m.id will show its id

d = Designer(designer_name="Sevtap")
d.save()

Designer.objects.all()   -will now bring all of our designers

To create a job:
from django.utils import timezone
t=timezone.now()
d.job_set.create(manufacturer=m, (other information optional) ,creation_date = t, start_date=t,completion_date=t,rejection_date=t)

In [49]: Job.objects.all()[0].completion_date
Out[49]: datetime.datetime(2019, 2, 8, 7, 45, 17, 519401, tzinfo=<UTC>)

In [50]: Job.objects.all()
Out[50]: <QuerySet [<Job: >, <Job: >]>


And whenever you change the models, always do, makemigrations on the app (job) and do migrate
